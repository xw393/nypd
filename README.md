In this practice, __Random Forest__ model is applied to make classification and prediction. By applying cross-validation grid search technique, best hyperparameters are selected, the accuracy can reach 98% on training set. However, when it comes to testset,  less than 40% accuracy implies that overfitting may exist in the model.
